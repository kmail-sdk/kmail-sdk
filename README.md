  A brief introduction to using the kmail-sdk.

Installation
---------------
```
$> npm install kmail-sdk [--save]
```

Setup
---------------
To initiate the package you'll need to run in init function to compile the .proto files:
```js
  const kmail = require('kmail-sdk');
  kmail.KmailProtoLoader.init(location).then(() => {
    //your code goes here
  });
  ```
* The `location` is the folder you keep the .proto directory Kmail had provided you. 
* `location` argument is optional and will take a default directory if not given or empty.

Keep in mind that if you your .proto folder is much different then the default one then this could be an indication this package isn't up to date and you might need to clone it and update the parts you need

Usage
---------------
In order use the SDK you need to take the kmailSDK and use it as follows:
```js
const Kmail = require('kmail-sdk');
Kmail.KmailProtoLoader.init().then(() => {  
  const licenseKey = 'zzz';
  const identity = 'xxx';
  const password = 'yyy';
  const kmailIP = 'tcp://1.0.0.127';
  const commandSocketProt = '1';
  const dataSocketProt = '2';
  const company = 'yourIdentity';
  // Creating the sdk object (you don't need more then 1)
  const kmail = new Kmail.KmailSDK(kmailIP, company, commandSocketProt, dataSocketProt, licenseKey, identity, password);

  kmail.emitter.on('statusUpdate', (newStatus) => {
    // Subscribe to all events coming from molly. in order to filter the needed object use the emitter and subscribe to the 
    // needed events
    kmail.subscribeToAll();
  });

  kmail.emitter.on('event', (event) => {
    console.log(`received an event object - "${event}"`);
  });

  kmail.connect(); 
});
```
